# Introduction

S3 Build Publisher is a set of MSBuild tasks for publishing to Amazon's AWS S3 service, and has been extended to include EC2 support.

# Details

MSBuild tasks library to interface with Amazon's AWS products, including EC2, S3 and SQS

To prevent the need for AWS credentials being stored in the MSBuild scripts the task StoreClientDetailsTask should be used to store the AWS client details in the local registry.

Before you can use any of the tasks the credentials must be stored, this is a one off action on your build machine, but remember to re-run when your secret key changes.

The secret key is encrypted with a salted container name, this container name must be supplied to any other AWS MSBuild task to ensure it can get the client connection credentials.

Latest builds can be downloaded from:

This uses the MSBuild AWS S3 publishing task to push the build as it's created to S3. 


#### Forked
This is a fork from the original on SnowCode google code: http://code.google.com/p/snowcode/

This is done so the project can have it's own identity and root rather than be mixed in with other projects.
